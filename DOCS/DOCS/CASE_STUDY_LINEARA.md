# Case Study: Morphic Reconstruction of Linear A
**Framework Author:** L.E.B.  
**Subject:** The Hagia Triada Corpus (HT 13, HT 85, HT 122)

---

## 1. Problem Statement
Linear A remains undeciphered phonetically. Standard linguistic models fail due to a lack of a bilingual "Rosetta Stone." 

## 2. UC 13954 Solution: Structural Isomorphism
We ignore the phonetic "noise" and focus on the **Commutative Diagrams** of the administrative process.

### A. The "Commodity" Terminal Objects
In 2026 research, signs such as **AB 120 (Barley)** and **AB 30 (Figs)** are treated as logical constants.
* **13954 Logic:** These act as **Terminal Objects** in the category of Trade. Every transaction must point toward these constants.

### B. The Distribution Morphism
By analyzing tablet **HT 13**, we identify a "Split-Arrow" flow.
* **Pattern:** One header sign leads to three distinct sign-groups, each followed by a fraction.
* **Morphism:** This is a **Co-Product ($\amalg$)**. It proves the logic of *Allocation*. Even without "reading" the words, the 13954 protocol identifies this as a "Distribution of Rations to Three Sub-Units."

## 3. Results of the Sheaf Analysis
By "gluing" the local data of the Hagia Triada tablets, UC 13954 reconstructs a **Global Inventory State**:
1. **The Sovereignty Rule:** The sign-group `KU-RO` acts as the **Summation Morphism** (The "All" or "Total").
2. **The Logic Gap:** If the internal math of a tablet doesn't add up to `KU-RO`, UC 13954 identifies a **Data Leak** (loss of commodity), providing insight into ancient Minoan accounting errors or taxes.
