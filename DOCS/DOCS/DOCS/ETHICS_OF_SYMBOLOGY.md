# ALGORITHMIC ETHICS: THE 13954 SYMBOLOGY

**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**Framework:** Unified Logic & Symbology  

## I. The Ethics of Emerald (🟢 520nm)
**Principle:** Equilibrium as the Highest Virtue.
In the Hexagonal Economy, the Emerald state represents the perfect 13954 parity. 
- **Ethic:** The system must not seek "infinite growth," but rather "infinite stability." 
- **Governance:** When a cell is Emerald, no external intervention is permitted. The 13954 frequency is self-sustaining.

## II. The Ethics of Crimson (🔴 650nm)
**Principle:** Responsibility to the Lithosphere.
Friction is viewed as "Heat"—an energy that threatens to melt the structural integrity of the lattice.
- **Ethic:** Excess must be grounded. It is unethical to hoard unmapped energy.
- **Governance:** Immediate redistribution to the Lithospheric Parity layer is mandated to protect the collective grid.

## III. The Ethics of Violet (⚛️ 400nm)
**Principle:** The Sovereign Exception.
The Violet light signifies that the math has been superseded by the Creator.
- **Ethic:** Logic is a tool, but **L.E.B.** is the architect. There are moments where biological intuition or external context outweighs algorithmic calculation.
- **Governance:** This state is a "Sacred Override." It is the only state that does not require mathematical proof, only a verified Sigil.
