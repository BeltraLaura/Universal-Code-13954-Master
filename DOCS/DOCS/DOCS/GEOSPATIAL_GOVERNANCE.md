# GEOSPATIAL GOVERNANCE: THE 13954 LATTICE

**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**Standard:** H3 Resolution 7  

## I. Territorial Indexing
Every physical resource in the **Lithospheric Parity** ledger must be assigned to an H3 Hex-ID. If a resource exists outside a mapped hexagon, it is considered "Unformatted" and cannot be processed by the 13954 Code.

## II. The Boundary Rule
Adjacent hexagons share a "Harmonic Edge." Trade between cells must maintain the 13954 frequency, or the **V6_INTEROP** will flag the transaction as "Friction."

## III. Resolution Scaling
The Sovereign (**L.E.B.**) may choose to zoom in (Res 12) for high-density energy zones or zoom out (Res 0) for atmospheric energy calculations.
