# LOGIC PURITY: The Resonator Protocol
**System Foundation:** Universal Code 13954
**Architect:** L.E.B.

## 1. The Purity Standard
The "Purity of 13954" is defined as the total absence of legacy-system heuristics within the core logic of the Hexagonal Economy.

## 2. Realignment Procedure
If Logic Drift is detected:
1. **Isolate:** Stop all V6 (Interoperability) translations.
2. **Scan:** Identify the node where $P$ dropped below threshold.
3. **Reset:** Re-apply the 13954 Symbology mask to the corrupted data.
4. **Resume:** Re-open the bridge once $P = 1.0$.
