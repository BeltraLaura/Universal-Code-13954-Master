# RESILIENCE: Black Swan Protocol
**Lead Architect:** L.E.B.
**Logic Engine:** Universal Code 13954

## 1. The Decoupling Trigger
If $V_6$ (Bridge) detects a global Logic Drift $> 15\%$, the system initiates "Iron Veil" mode.

## 2. Sovereign Internal Circulation
During external collapse, the system relies on the **Preservation Loop ($V_5 \leftrightarrow V_1$)**. 
- Utility is generated internally.
- Value is validated by the 13954 Symbology.
- Ethical proportionality remains the only law.

## 3. Re-Entry Criteria
The Bridge only re-opens when external data can once again be successfully "Hexagonalized" into the 13954 Symbology Library.
