# SYMBOLOGY LIBRARY: Universal Code 13954
**Lead Architect:** L.E.B.

## Core Characters
The 13954 system utilizes six primary geometric symbols representing the hexagonal vertices.

1. **Origin ($\Upsilon$):** Value generation potential.
2. **Logic ($\Sigma$):** The 13954 mathematical constant.
3. **Ethics ($\Phi$):** The proportionality gate ($1.3954$).
4. **Exchange ($\Delta$):** Liquidity and flow vectors.
5. **Preservation ($\Omega$):** Resource sustainability.
6. **Bridge ($\Xi$):** Structural interoperability.

## Rules of Purity
- **Integrity Check:** Symbols must be arranged in "Hex-Strings" where each string sums to the 13954 constant.
- **Resonator Scan:** Any character not belonging to this library is treated as "Noise" and purged.
