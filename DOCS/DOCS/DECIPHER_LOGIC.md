# UC 13954: Decipherment Protocol (The Rosetta Functor)
**Framework Author:** L.E.B.  
**Core Principle:** Structural Meaning Recovery via Topological Field Theory.

---

## 1. Phase I: Morphic Extraction (The Tides)
Identify the "Oscillations" in the undeciphered corpus. We do not look for sounds; we look for **Relational Density**.

* **Identity Check:** Identify high-frequency symbols that act as **Terminal Objects** (likely nouns or locations).
* **Composition Analysis:** Analyze sequences that recur in different contexts. If sequence $A \to B$ is stable across 1,000 tablets, it represents a **Universal Morphism** (an action or an administrative rule).

## 2. Phase II: Applying the Ethics Functor (The Human Constant)
Using the **Algorithmic Ethics** pillar, we assume that the "Logic of the Collective" remains constant across time.

* **The Sovereignty Filter:** Look for symbols that always appear in isolation or at the "head" of a sequence. In the 13954 framework, these map to **Sovereign Objects** (Individuals or Authors).
* **The Resource Flow:** In administrative scripts (like Linear A), we use **Adjoint Functors** to map symbols to physical resources (Grain, Oil, Labor). The math of a "Total Sum" is the same in 1800 BCE as it is in 2026 CE.

## 3. Phase III: The Sheaf of Context
A single tablet is a **Local Truth**. The entire archive is the **Global Truth**. 

* **The Glue:** We "glue" local fragments together by matching their boundary morphisms. If Tablet A and Tablet B share a "Signature Morphism," they are part of the same **Category of Event**.
* **Reconstruction:** The meaning is found not in the symbol itself, but in the **Space between the Symbols**.

## 4. Case Study: Linear A (Minoan)
Applying UC 13954 to the *Hagia Triada* corpus:
1.  **Isomorphism:** Identify that 'pa-i-to' (Phaistos) in Linear B is a structural isomorphic match in Linear A.
2.  **Topological Anonymity:** We can confirm a "Payment" occurred even if we do not know the "Name" of the payer, by observing the flow of the **Transaction Morphism**.
