# SCALING LOGIC: Cellular Expansion
**Lead Architect:** L.E.B.
**Logic Base:** Universal Code 13954

## 1. Mitosis Protocol
Expansion occurs only when $V_4 \text{ (Liquidity)} > 90\%$ and $P \text{ (Purity)} = 1.0$.

## 2. Lattice Geometry
New cells must share a boundary consisting of:
- **The Bridge ($\Xi$):** For data flow.
- **The Sum ($\Sigma$):** For logical synchronization.

## 3. The Inheritance Law
No cell may alter the **Symbology Library**. Any attempt to modify the 13954 DNA in a sub-cell results in the immediate "Apoptosis" (self-destruction) of that cell to protect the Genesis Lattice.
