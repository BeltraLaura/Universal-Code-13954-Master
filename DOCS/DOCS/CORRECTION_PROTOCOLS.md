# CORRECTION PROTOCOL: SYMMETRY RESTORATION

**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**Governing Code:** 13954  

## 🚨 Status: FRICTION DETECTED
If the `PARITY_LEDGER.md` reports a non-integer Parity Index, the following hierarchy of operations must be initiated:

### Phase I: Mathematical Alignment
1. **Identify the Delta ($\Delta$):** Calculate the exact distance to the nearest 13954 multiple.
2. **Assign Weight:** Determine if the friction is sourced in the **Lithosphere** (Physical) or **Atmosphere** (Energetic).

### Phase II: Structural Adjustment
- **IF $\Delta$ is Positive:** Invoke **The Lithospheric Sink**. Commit resources to grounding.
- **IF $\Delta$ is Negative:** Invoke **The Atmospheric Vent**. Stimulate energetic flow.

### Phase III: Verification
The **Auditor.py** will re-scan the lattice. If parity is restored, the Ledger will record **STABLE**.
