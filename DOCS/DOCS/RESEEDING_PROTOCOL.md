# PROTOCOL: Operation Phoenix (Re-Seeding)
**Lead Architect:** L.E.B.
**Logic Base:** Universal Code 13954

## 1. The Beacon Principle
When $V_6$ (Bridge) detects external stability, it broadcasts the 13954 "Logic Template."

## 2. Mandatory Alignment
External systems cannot connect unless they implement:
- **The Symbology Library:** For structural compatibility.
- **The Proportionality Gate:** To prevent the return of extractive cycles.

## 3. Structural Induction
The Hexagonal Economy shall act as the "Parent Lattice," providing logical stability to "Child Nodes" until they achieve independent equilibrium ($K$).
