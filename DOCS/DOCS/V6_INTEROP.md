# PROTOCOL: Vertex 6 - Interoperability Bridge
**Logic Base:** Universal Code 13954  
**Architect:** L.E.B.

## 1. Gateway Standards
All outgoing data must be translated via the **13954-Legacy Mapping Table**. This ensures that the ethical weight ($\rho$) is represented even in systems that do not natively support Algorithmic Ethics.

## 2. Translation Function (T_v6)
For any external interaction $E$:
`T_v6(Data) = Convert(13954 -> Target_Protocol)`
*Requirement:* The transformation must be bi-directional and lossless.

## 3. Structural Integrity Check
If an external system attempts to push data *into* the hexagon:
1. Data enters the **Quarantine Sandbox**.
2. Vertex 2 attempts to "Hexagonalize" the data.
3. If the data cannot be represented in 13954 Symbology, it is rejected at the Bridge.


# V6 INTEROPERABILITY PROTOCOL

**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**System Integrity:** Universal Code 13954  

## I. The External Handshake
No raw data is permitted to enter the **Lithospheric Parity** ledger without first passing through the V6 Gateway. 

## II. The Normalization Rule
Legacy systems are inherently chaotic. The V6 Interop script applies "Pressure" to external data, forcing it into the nearest 13954 harmonic. 

## III. Data Sovereignty
Data that has been translated via V6_INTEROP is marked with a "HEX-ID." This allows **L.E.B.** to track which parts of the economy are native and which are adapted from legacy sources.
