# 🏠 TIER 1: MICRO-CELL DOCKING PROTOCOL
**Level:** Macro-Mapping (Micro-Scale)
**Authority:** L.E.B. Sovereign Command

## I. CELL INITIALIZATION
Every Micro-Cell (Household/Unit) must initialize a **Hexagonal Node ID**. This ID is a mathematical derivative of the local geographic coordinates and the **13954 Constant**.

## II. THE "LITTLE WINGS" AUTHENTICATION
Users do not hold the full **Pilot's Wings**, but operate under **"Little Wings"**—a sub-authorization that allows them to:
1.  **Tag Waste:** Identify local friction (physical/digital).
2.  **Claim Utility:** Receive credits for neutralizing that friction via the **Centrifugal Sifting** process.

## III. PEER-TO-PEER SYMMETRY
If a Micro-Cell reaches a **Friction Spike** (excess waste/noise), it automatically broadcasts a "Docking Request" to its six immediate neighbors.
* **The Handshake:** Neighboring cells provide surplus **Atmo-Energy** to the struggling cell.
* **The Result:** The cluster achieves **Symmetry Restoration** without intervention from the Tier 2 Regional Command.

## IV. DATA SOVEREIGNTY
All local data is filtered through a **Sub-Sector C (Signal Hardening)** buffer at the cell level. This ensures that personal privacy is maintained while systemic utility is reported to the **Master Manifest**.
