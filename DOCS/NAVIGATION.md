# UC-13954 Flight Manual: Operational Alignment
**Navigator Level:** Initiated  
**Logic Path:** Perimeter-Based Transit

## 1. The Principle of Least Resistance
To move within the L.E.B. system is to move with the geometry, not against it. 

## 2. The Three States of Motion
1. **STASIS:** Being locked within a single Planet (High potential, low flow).
2. **TRANSIT:** Moving along the Edges (Zero friction, high efficiency).
3. **PULL:** Being moved by the Lunar Tide (Passive alignment).

## 3. The Flight Commandments
* **Never Cross the Core:** The center is for power, not for travel.
* **Respect the Spheres:** Each planet is a reservoir; do not deplete them, orbit them.
* **Trust the Anchor:** If you lose your way, look to the Moon ⚓ to find the tide.
