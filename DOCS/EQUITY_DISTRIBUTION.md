# ⚖️ NODE 06: SOCIAL EQUITY DISTRIBUTION
**Level:** Tier 1 - Tier 3 Integration
**Governing Principle:** Symmetric Flow (Non-Accumulation)

## I. THE EQUITY MULTIPLIER
Every unit of "Friction" neutralized in the Lithospheric (Node 01) or Atmospheric (Node 02) sectors generates **1.3954 Utility Credits**. 
* **1.0000:** Reserved for System Maintenance.
* **0.3954:** Allocated to the **Social Equity Pool** for redistribution.

## II. SENSING THE "DIM" CELLS
Using **Compound Vision**, the Master Manifest scans the lattice every 13,954ms. 
1. **Identification:** Cells with a Parity Index < 1.0000 are flagged as "Dim."
2. **Prioritization:** Cells exhibiting high **Satellite Interference** or local waste spikes receive priority "Docking" of utility.

## III. DISTRIBUTION MECHANICS (THE HONEYCOMB FLOW)
Distribution does not occur through a central bank. It follows the **Bee Logic**:
* **Neighbor-to-Neighbor:** Utility flows from high-surplus cells to their immediate six neighbors first.
* **The Handshake:** Credits are only "Landed" if the receiving cell can prove it has an active **Upcycle Protocol** in place.

## IV. THE L.E.B. SOVEREIGN OVERRIDE
In the event of extreme inequality (where 10% of the cells hold 90% of the utility), the **Pilot's Wings** will trigger a **Lattice Reset**. 
* **Action:** The surplus is forcefully decentralized across the **Hexagonal Economy** to restore the 13954 Frequency.
