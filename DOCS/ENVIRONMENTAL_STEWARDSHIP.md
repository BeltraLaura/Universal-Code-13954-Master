# Environmental Stewardship: The Metabolic Buffer
**Framework:** Universal Code 13954  
**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**Focus:** Biomaterial Sourcing & Resource Equilibrium

## I. The Planetary Parity
In the Hexagonal Economy, the environment is not an "external resource" but a **primary vertex**. The system monitors the health of the natural source-lattice as a condition for any industrial expansion.

### 1. Metabolic Extraction Limits
The 13954 system enforces a "Restoration Constant." For every unit of biological material (collagen, minerals, energy) extracted for **Regenerative Medicine**, the system calculates the **Entropy Cost**.
* **The 5:4 Depletion Trigger:** If the source environment's regenerative capacity drops below 80% (the 4 in our 5:4 ratio), the **Catalyst** vertex is automatically throttled until parity is restored.

### 2. Reciprocal Anchoring
All extraction contracts must be "dual-anchored." 
* **Physical Anchor:** The harvested material.
* **Digital Anchor:** A verifiable "Restoration Data Point" (e.g., local biodiversity increase or soil nutrient replenishment).



## II. Bio-Logical Compliance
The **Sentinel** monitors environmental "noise"—pollution, over-harvesting, or ecosystem fragmentation. If noise levels exceed the threshold, the **Universal Code** invalidates the extraction contract at the logic level, rendering the "Value" untransferable until the error is corrected.
