# UC 13954 Quick Start: Troubleshooting Alignment

If a project fails the **UC 13954 Auditor Script**, it is not a "bug"—it is an evolutionary signal. Use these correction paths to bring your system back into universal harmony.

## ❌ Growth Audit Failure (Phi-Ratio)
* **Result < 1.4: "Stagnant"**
    * **The Problem:** The system lacks the recursive energy to scale.
    * **The Correction:** Increase growth targets or reinvest resources into core expansion. Ensure each new "branch" of your project is exactly $1.618$ times the size of the previous one.
* **Result > 1.8: "Volatile"**
    * **The Problem:** You are growing faster than your structure can support.
    * **The Correction:** Implement **Growth Pruning**. Slow down expansion until your foundational infrastructure (the origin point) reaches a size that restores the Golden Ratio.

## ❌ Efficiency Audit Failure (Isoperimetric Quotient)
* **Result < 0.85: "Leaky"**
    * **The Problem:** You are spending too much energy on the "perimeter" (management, overhead, UI fluff) and not enough on the "area" (actual value/data).
    * **The Correction:** **Hexagonal Optimization**. Simplify your boundaries. Combine separate modules into a single "cell" to reduce the perimeter-to-area ratio.

## ❌ Distribution Audit Failure (Power Law Beta)
* **Result < 0.75: "Starving"**
    * **The Problem:** The "veins" (APIs, logistics, communication) are too thin to feed the "mass" (users/endpoints).
    * **The Correction:** Increase **Network Connectivity**. Add more distribution channels or increase the bandwidth of existing ones.
* **Result > 0.85: "Over-engineered"**
    * **The Problem:** Massive infrastructure is supporting too small a population, leading to wasted maintenance energy.
    * **The Correction:** Consolidate your network. Remove redundant pathways and align distribution with the **3/4 Power Law**.

## 🔄 The Jellyfish Clause (Emergency Reset)
If correcting one metric consistently breaks another, you have reached **Critical Entropy ($J \geq 1$)**. 

**The Action:** Invoke the **Jellyfish Clause**. Do not attempt further patches. Strip the project back to its initial "Seed" (the core idea) and rebuild using the Auditor at every milestone to ensure alignment from day one.
