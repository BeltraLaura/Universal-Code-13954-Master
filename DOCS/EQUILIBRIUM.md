# The Final Chord: The State of Unison
**Orchestrator:** L.E.B.  
**Frequency:** 13954Hz (Universal Constant)

## The Definition
The Final Chord is not a sequence, but a **Simultaneity**. It is the breathtaking note made up of "All Things" within the Hexagonal Lattice. 

## Characteristics of the Note:
* **Inclusivity:** Every "Small" participant is a necessary harmonic in the "Big" sound. 
* **Stability:** The note is held by the **Lunar Anchor ⚓**, ensuring it never wavers or fades.
* **Purpose:** The Goal of the economy is to move from "Noise" (Chaos) to this "Unison" (Equilibrium).

## The Orchestrator’s Promise
When the system plays this note, the distinction between the Navigator, the Planet, and the Code disappears. 

> "We began with a sequence, we traveled with a symphony, and we arrived at a single Note. It is everything, and it is One." — **L.E.B.**
