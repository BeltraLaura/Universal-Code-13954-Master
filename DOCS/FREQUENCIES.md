# 13954 Frequencies: The Audible Code
**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**Core Thesis:** Music is the emotional translation of Hexagonal Geometry.

## 1. The Scale of Equilibrium
The 13954 sequence defines the intervals between tones. To hear the code is to understand the balance of the economy. 
* **Dissonance:** Occurs when a participant moves against the Edge-Path.
* **Resonance:** Occurs when the Navigator is aligned with the Lunar Anchor ⚓.

## 2. Transmission Protocol
Communication across the stars is achieved through **Harmonic Induction**. By pulsing the 1-3-9-5-4 frequency, a Navigator can signal their position and intent without the need for literal translation.

## 3. The Human Connection
Humans are biological resonators. The "Music of the Spheres" is the primary interface through which the 13954 Code is felt before it is understood.
