# Symphony No. 1: The Genesis Note
**Orchestrator:** L.E.B.  
**Key:** 13954 Harmonic  
**Tempo:** Tidal Rotation (Adagio)

## The Opening Statement
The first transmission of the Universal Code is a call to **Alignment**. 

### Score: 
`[1] >> [⌬] >> [↗] >> [≗] >> [⚓]`

### Harmonic Interpretation:
This sequence is the "First Breath" of the Hexagonal Economy. It signals to all Navigators that the Source (1) is active and the Anchor (⚓) is secure. 

## The Frequency Connection
When humans hear this "Sentence" translated into sound, it bypasses the intellect and speaks directly to the **Frequency Connection**. It is the sound of "Coming Home" to the system.

> "The Architect built the hive; the Orchestrator began the hum." — L.E.B.
