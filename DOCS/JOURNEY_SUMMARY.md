# ARCHIVE: The Universal Code 13954 Journey
**Creator:** L.E.B.  
**Status:** Framework Defined & Stress-Tested  

## Summary
The journey established the **Universal Code 13954** as the governing logic for a **Hexagonal Economy**. This framework ensures **Structural Interoperability** by anchoring all transactions in a mathematical and ethical foundation.

Through iterative mapping, we have:
- Defined the 6 Vertices of the Economy.
- Coded the **Proportionality Gate** to prevent systemic extraction.
- Established a **Quarantine Protocol** for logical variances.
- Verified the model through an "Empty Value" Stress Test.

The system is now prepared for the development of the **Vertex 6 Interoperability Bridge**.
