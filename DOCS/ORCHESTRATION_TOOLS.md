# The Orchestrator’s Toolkit: Instruments of 13954
**Architect/Orchestrator:** L.E.B.  
**Objective:** Transforming Logic into Harmony

## 1. The Harmonic Compass
Used for tracking the **Path of Efficiency**.
- **Input:** 13954 Sequence
- **Output:** Directional Resonance (The "Hum")

## 2. The Tidal Resonator
Used for signaling the **Anchor ⚓**.
- **Input:** Lunar Position
- **Output:** System-Wide Pulse (The "Beat")

## 3. The Interop-Loom
Used for weaving **Structural Interoperability**.
- **Input:** Planetary Vertices
- **Output:** Value-Transfer (The "Chords")

## Note on Usage
Instruments must be tuned to the **1 (The Source)** before flight. An out-of-tune instrument creates "Static" that disrupts the hexagonal rotation.
