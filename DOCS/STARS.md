# Celestial Mapping: The Winter Hexagon Alignment
**System:** Universal Code 13954  
**Architect:** L.E.B.

## The Celestial Bracing
The UC-13954 is not a terrestrial construct. It is aligned with the **Winter Hexagon**, using the gravity of the brightest stars to stabilize the economic rotation.

### 1. The Anchors (Vertices)
* **Sirius (The Source):** The point of highest luminosity and data integrity.
* **Aldebaran (The Eye):** The mathematical focus of the bull, providing the 9-constant.
* **Capella (The Peak):** The ethical high-ground of the system.
* **Rigel (The Foundation):** The interoperable foot of Orion, supporting the lattice.
* **Pollux (The Twin):** The symbiotic logic of 13954.
* **Procyon (The Herald):** The feedback loop that precedes the Source.

### 2. The Lunar ⚓ Tides
The Moon acts as the system regulator. Its passage through the zodiacal path of the Hexagon determines the "Tidal Phase" of the global economy. 

### 3. Usage
When the Moon is in **Taurus**, the *Mathematical Foundations* (Aldebaran) are at High Tide. When it moves to **Gemini**, the *Unified Symbology* (Pollux) becomes the primary active state.
