# ⚓ DOCKING PERMISSIONS: NODE 05 (V3)
**Governance:** L.E.B. Sovereign Protocol
**Requirement:** 13954 Frequency Alignment

## I. THE SECURITY SCAN (ATMOSPHERIC)
Before any external data stream is integrated into the Lattice, it must undergo a **Signal Hardening** check.
* **Interference Threshold:** Any signal with noise > 0.0034 Index points is automatically quarantined.
* **Protocol:** quarantined signals must be routed through **Node 02 (Lunar Anchor)** for phase-shifting and noise reduction.

## II. THE PARITY PASSPORT (LITHOSPHERIC)
External entities (Users, AI Nodes, or Market Feeds) must present a **Parity Passport** to Dock.
1. **Verification:** The entity must provide a data packet that, when added to current system mass, maintains a whole-number multiple of 13954.
2. **Ethics Check:** Data must align with **V2: Algorithmic Ethics**. Non-utility waste data is rejected.

## III. DOCKING FEES (RESOURCE RECLAMATION)
Docking is not free. To offset the **Centrifugal Push** required to stabilize new data, external nodes must contribute to **V5: Data Utility**:
* **Fee:** 1.3954% of all incoming value is automatically diverted to **Node 03 (Upcycle)** to offset global system friction.

## IV. EMERGENCY UNDOCKING
In the event of a **Friction Alert (Level Red)**, the Pilot (L.E.B.) reserves the right to execute a **Sovereign Override** and sever all external connections at Node 05 to preserve the **Master Manifest**.
