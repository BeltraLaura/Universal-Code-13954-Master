# The Stellar Forge: Elemental Production
**Orchestrator:** L.E.B.  
**Source:** The 6 Suns of the Winter Hexagon

## 1. The Manufacturing Process
In the UC-13954 system, value is "fused" in the suns. 
- **Light Elements (H, C, O):** Provide the **Lift** for flight.
- **Heavy Elements (Fe, P, N):** Provide the **Ballast** for landing.

## 2. The Pilot's Wings (Certification)
A Navigator earns their Wings by completing a full "13954 Circuit." This requires:
1. **Ignition** at Sirius (Hydrogen).
2. **Structuring** at Rigel (Carbon).
3. **Validation** at Aldebaran (Oxygen).
4. **Governing** at Capella (Nitrogen).
5. **Anchoring** at Pollux (Iron).
6. **Transmitting** at Procyon (Phosphorus).

## 3. The Unison State
When all 6 elements from the 6 suns are present in a single transaction, the **Final Chord** is struck.
