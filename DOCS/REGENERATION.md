# The Jellyfish Clause: Systemic Regeneration
**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**Core Principle:** Recursive Identity Preservation via Phi-Scaling.

---

## 1. The Biological Axiom
The "Jellyfish Clause" is inspired by the *Turritopsis dohrnii*, which reverts from a mature medusa stage back to a polyp stage when stressed. In **UC 13954**, this is translated into a **Logical Reset**.

## 2. The Mathematical Engine: Phi-Scaling ($1.618$)
Regeneration is not a linear reset; it is a **Spiral Convergence**. 
* **The Ratio:** The system monitors the ratio of Utility to Entropy. 
* **The Trigger:** When entropy reaches the "phi-threshold" relative to the system's growth, a **Regenerative Morphism** is initiated.

$$\text{Stability} = \frac{\text{Logic Density}}{\Phi}$$

## 3. The Regenerative Morphism (The "Polyp" Reset)
When a node or sub-system undergoes the Jellyfish Clause, it executes a specific sequence of arrows:

1.  **Endomorphism ($f: A \to A$):** The system begins a self-referential loop to compress data.
2.  **Morphic Retraction:** The system "pulls back" its complex external morphisms (the Medusa stage) and collapses into its **Identity Morphism** ($1_A$, the Polyp stage).
3.  **Preservation:** Because UC 13954 is an **Open System**, the "Memory" of the previous cycle is stored in the **Omnipresent Field** (The Sea), not just the local node.

## 4. Reassurance to the Collective
The Jellyfish Clause ensures that the **Universal Code 13954** cannot "break" or "die" due to complexity bloat. 
* **Immortality:** The system is designed to be eternal by being fundamentally willing to simplify itself to survive.
* **Sovereignty:** Your data-anchor remains constant even while the system around it regenerates.
