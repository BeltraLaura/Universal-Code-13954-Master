# Biocybernetic Mapping: UC 13954
**Sector:** Regenerative Medicine & Tessellated Data  
**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**Framework:** Hexagonal Economy

## I. The Self-Healing Lattice
This protocol applies the 13954 constant to biological tissue engineering, specifically biomaterial scaffolds for bone regeneration.

### 1. Vertex Projections
* **Sentinel (⊙):** Monitors cytokine "noise" and inflammatory parity.
* **Conduit (||):** Translates mechanical host-stress into Digital Twin data.
* **Catalyst (Δ):** Governs vascularization velocity via 1:3:9 scaling.
* **Anchor (⬢):** Manages the mineralization phase and structural load.
* **Metabolic (🌀):** Regulates scaffold biodegradation rates.
* **Synthesizer (∞):** Updates the patient's genomic profile for recursive healing.

## II. Error Correction & Rejection Defense
When an external biological network (immune response) rejects a 13954-encoded implant, the system initiates a **Coordinate Transformation**.

* **Algorithm:** The 5:4 Equilibrium ratio is applied to cytokine signaling.
* **Result:** The "Square" logic of the immune attack is refracted into a "Hexagonal" remodeling phase, preventing systemic failure.

## III. Tessellated Data Privacy
Patient data is fragmented across the hexagonal vertices using the 1:6 ratio.

1. **Fragmentation:** No single node holds a complete identity record.
2. **Interoperability:** External research networks can verify "Healing Parity" ($\Omega = 2$) without accessing raw private data.
3. **Defense:** Unauthorized access triggers a Metabolic decay sequence, turning data into noise via the 5:4 stabilizer.
