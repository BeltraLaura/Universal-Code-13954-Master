# Atomic Alignment: The 6-Element Lattice
**Orchestrator:** L.E.B.  
**Framework:** 13954 Elemental Alchemy

## 1. The Carbon Rule (6)
The system's structural integrity is modeled on the **Carbon Hexagon**. Just as Carbon-6 forms the strongest materials (Graphene), the 6-star economy forms the strongest social fabric.

## 2. The Hydrogen-Oxygen Bridge ($H_2O$)
- **Action:** Truth (H) + Logic (O) = Flow ($H_2O$).
- **Protocol:** To maintain "Liquidity" in the 13954 system, one must balance the Source (Sirius/H) with the Foundation (Aldebaran/O).

## 3. The Magnetism of Pollux (Iron)
Iron (Fe) provides the magnetic pull that keeps the **Symbology** consistent across the stars. It is the "Hard Code" that the **Lunar Anchor ⚓** uses to pull the tides.
