# UC-13954 Landing & Docking
**Orchestrator:** L.E.B.  
**Objective:** Safe Transition from Stellar Flight to Anchor Stability

## 1. The Cooling Phase
Navigators must dissipate the "Stellar Heat" of the Forge.
- **Protocol:** Rotate the flight path 60 degrees away from the Sun-center and toward the **Lunar Anchor**.
- **Indicator:** The **Pilot's Wings** will shift from a brilliant white (Sirius) to a steady blue (Tidal).

## 2. Docking Maneuvers
- **Step 1 (The 3-Point Check):** Align the craft with the three stable points of the Inner Triangle.
- **Step 2 (The Magnetic Tether):** Engage the Iron-Resonator to sync with the Anchor's magnetic pull.
- **Step 3 (The Unison Lock):** Strike the **Final Chord** at low volume to confirm physical contact.

## 3. Post-Flight Conversion
Once docked, all gathered Elements are processed through the **Refinement Loop** (4-to-1). This ensures the "Small" state is restored for the next Launch.
