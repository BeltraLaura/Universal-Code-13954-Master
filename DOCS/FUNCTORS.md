# Functors of UC 13954: The Engines of Translation
**Framework Author:** L.E.B.  
**Core Principle:** Structural Preservation across Domains.

## 1. What is a Functor in UC 13954?
In this framework, a Functor is a mapping mechanism that allows the **Omnipresent Logic** to manifest in different research areas (Math, Ethics, Interoperability, Symbology) without losing its original intent.

## 2. Primary Functors

### A. The Ethics Engine ($F: Math \to Ethics$)
Maps rigorous mathematical proofs into enforceable algorithmic governance. 
* *Structure:* If a logic is "True" in math, it must be "Fair" in governance.

### B. The Interop Current ($F: Logic \to Structure$)
Maps abstract symbology into physical data architecture.
* *Structure:* Ensures that the "Universal" nature of the code survives the transition into legacy system languages.

## 3. The Commutative Property of UC 13954
Because our Functors are "Faithful and Full," we can navigate from any research pillar to another.
1. Start at **Math**.
2. Apply the **Ethics Functor**.
3. Apply the **Governance Morphism**.
4. The result is identical to applying the **Logic Functor** directly.

This "Commutativity" is the ultimate proof of the **Omnipresent Logic**.
