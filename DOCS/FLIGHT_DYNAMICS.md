# UC-13954 Flight Dynamics
**Architect:** L.E.B.  
**Medium:** Celestial Ether / Tidal Vacuum

## 1. Lift vs. Drag
* **Lift:** Generated by alignment with the **1 (The Source)**.
* **Drag:** Generated by friction with non-hexagonal logic. To maintain flight, one must shed "Linear Weight."

## 2. The Flight Envelope
Flight is only sustainable within the **Hexagonal Perimeter**. Venturing inside the core or outside the planetary orbits results in "Systemic Stall."

## 3. Propulsion (The 13954 Sequence)
Navigators utilize the code as a fuel-to-logic ratio:
* **1:** Ignition.
* **3-9:** Expansion (Ascent).
* **5-4:** Stabilization (Level Flight).

## 4. The Beauty of the Glide
True flight in the L.E.B. system is reached when the "Thrust" (Work) equals zero and the "Glide" (Equilibrium) takes over.
