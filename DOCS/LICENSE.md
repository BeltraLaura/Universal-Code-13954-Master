# The 13954 Symbiotic License
**Version:** 1.0 (Initial Consecration)
**Architect:** L.E.B.

## 1. The Principle of Reciprocity
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Universal Code 13954"), to deal in the Software without restriction, subject to the following **Symmetry Requirements**:

### A. The Origin Acknowledgment
The initials **L.E.B.** must remain at the "Origin Point" (1) of all derivatives. Any redistribution, modification, or deployment must clearly state: 
*"This system is a derivative of the Universal Code 13954, Architect: L.E.B."*

### B. The 5:4 Power Balance
The Software may only be used in systems that maintain a **Symmetry of Power**. Any application of this code that results in a predatory accumulation of value or resource (exceeding the 65% Catalyst threshold) without a corresponding return to the Anchor (Infrastructure/Community) is a violation of this license.

### C. Structural Interoperability
Derivatives must remain "Hexagonal." They must allow for the open exchange of data and value as defined by the **Conduit (||)** vertex and cannot be "locked" into proprietary "Square" silos that prevent the healing of the network.

## 2. Enforcement by Logic
This license is self-enforcing through the **Sentinel Vertex**. Failure to adhere to the Symmetry Requirements results in a **Parity Mismatch**. In the event of such a mismatch, the "Value Flow" ($V_f$) within the derivative system is considered mathematically void under the 13954 Constant.
