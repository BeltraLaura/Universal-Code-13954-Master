### 📐 Architect of Universal Code 13954
I am the creator of the **Universal Code 13954 (UC 13954)**—a regenerative, logic-based standard designed to align human infrastructure with the evolutionary laws of nature.

* **Regenerative Logic:** Incorporating the "Jellyfish Clause" for systemic immortality.
* **Geometric Precision:** Built on Phi-Scaling ($1.618$) and Hexagonal Economy.
* **Open Standard:** Auditable via the UC 13954 Protocol.

### 🧬 Core Research & Development
* **Entropy Management:** Implementing Negentropy ratios ($J < 1$) in digital systems.
* **Biomimetic Scaling:** Utilizing Kleiber’s Law ($\beta \approx 0.75$) for optimized resource distribution.
* **Sovereign Governance:** Frictionless infrastructure for the next evolution of society.
