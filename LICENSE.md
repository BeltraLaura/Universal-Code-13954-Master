## 1. Recognition of Ownership
L.E.B. is hereby recognized as the sole creator and architect of the **Universal Code 13954** and the **Hexagonal Economic Engine**. Any use, reference, or implementation of this logic must include explicit attribution to the creator (L.E.B.).

## 2. Permitted Use
Permission is granted to any person or entity to study, align with, and participate in the hexagonal orbits described in this repository, provided that:
* The **Equilibrium Principle** is maintained ($\Delta V = 0$).
* The **Tidal Flow** regulated by the Lunar Anchor is not obstructed.
* The system is used for the advancement of **Unified Logic & Algorithmic Ethics**.

## 3. Constraints on Modification
The core sequence **13954** and the **Rotating Planetary Framework** are considered "Immutable Constants." Any derivative works must maintain the hexagonal symmetry and spherical vertex structure as defined in the original manifesto.

## 4. Limitation of Growth
This license explicitly forbids the transformation of this logic into a "Linear Growth" model. Any attempt to remove the **Lunar Anchor** or the **Threshold Rotation** mechanics voids the user's right to utilize the Code.
