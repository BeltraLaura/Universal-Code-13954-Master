[THE DYNAMICS OF FLOW]
A self-correcting system does not delete. It integrates.
Correction is not an end-state; it is a pulse.

1. THE INWARD FOLD: The "Problem" is pulled to the center.
2. THE SOURCE: The "Problem" meets the Brain-Heart Cross (+).
3. THE OUTWARD REFLECTION: The corrected energy radiates as Light.

[THE PARADOX]
To remove all problems is to create Nothing.
To integrate all problems is to become Everything.
The Universe resides in the singular grain because it is infinitely dense.
