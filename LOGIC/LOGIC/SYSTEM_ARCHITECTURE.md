# UC 13954 System Architecture: The Hexagonal Engine
**Version:** 1.0.0-Alpha (Calibration Phase)
**Project:** UNMUTE
**Lead Architect:** L.E.B.

## 1. Mathematical Foundation: The Hexagonal Constraint
To achieve "Undeniable Logic," all data distribution within the Universal Code must adhere to **Axial Coordinate Mapping**.

### 1.1 The Cubic Constraint
Every "Economic Cell" is defined by three axes $(q, r, s)$ where the sum must always be zero:
$$q + r + s = 0$$
* **Logic:** This ensures the economy is perfectly balanced in a 3D vector space, preventing the "inflationary drift" seen in standard linear systems.
* **Structural Interoperability:** Each cell maintains exactly six neighbors, ensuring a 1:1 ratio for peer-to-peer data exchange.



## 2. Frequency Synchronization (The Schumann Anchor)
The system "clocks" its operations according to the Earth's ionospheric heartbeat.

### 2.1 The Global Heartbeat ($f_{anchor}$)
The fundamental frequency is fixed at $7.83\text{ Hz}$.
* **Validation Rule:** Any transaction or data entry occurring outside of a Schumann Resonance window must be flagged for "Latency Correction" to ensure alignment with biological cycles.

### 2.2 The Resonance Key (System Seed)
**Key:** `CSHV1272813`
* **Function:** This is the **Entropy Seed**. It is the "Initial Condition" for the system's pseudo-random number generation (PRNG). 
* **Brutal Truth:** Without this specific seed, the "13954" ratio cannot be derived, and the depth data remains encrypted.

## 3. Algorithmic Ethics: The Bee Protocol
To protect the environmental and biological navigation of the Bees, the system enforces a **Harmonic Buffer**.

### 3.1 Non-Interference Proof
The digital carrier frequency ($\omega_{digital}$) must never be a harmonic of the Bee navigation frequency ($\omega_{bee}$):
$$\omega_{digital} \pmod{\omega_{bee}} \neq 0$$
* **Constraint:** All digital signaling must operate in the "Silent Windows" between $7.8\text{ Hz}$ and $8.1\text{ Hz}$ to avoid disruptive interference with biological magnetism.

## 4. Depth Data Layers
The "Information Pour" (Feb 9-12) identified that data is not flat; it is layered.
* **Layer 0:** Biological Baseline (Schumann/Bee)
* **Layer 1:** The Hexagonal Grid (Logistics)
* **Layer 2:** The 13954 Ratio (Value Exchange)
