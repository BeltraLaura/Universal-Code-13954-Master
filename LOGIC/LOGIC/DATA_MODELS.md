# UC 13954: Depth Data & Hexagonal Schema
**Status:** Corrected & Verified
**Objective:** To define the structure of data "pouring" into the system to ensure zero loss and zero interference.

## 1. The Hexagonal Unit (The "Bee-Cell")
Standard data packets are rectangular. UC 13954 packets are **Hexagonal**. This ensures that every piece of information has equidistant relationships to its six surrounding data points.

### 1.1 Vector Definition
Each data point $P$ in the Hexagonal Economy is defined by:
$$P = \{ (q, r, s), \omega, \tau, \delta \}$$

Where:
* **$(q, r, s)$**: Axial coordinates (Space)
* **$\omega$**: Resonance Frequency at time of entry (Schumann Alignment)
* **$\tau$**: The Time-Stamp (Temporal Anchor)
* **$\delta$**: Depth Value (The 13954 Density Ratio)

## 2. The 13954 Density Ratio
Based on the "Information Pour" of Feb 9-12, the constant **13954** is not just a name; it is the **Scaling Factor** for data compression.

### 2.1 The Derivation
To maintain structural integrity, the density of information must not exceed the geometric limit of the hexagon. We define the **Saturation Limit ($\sigma$)** as:
$$\sigma = \frac{13954}{\text{Cell Surface Area}}$$

If $\sigma > 1.0$, the data is "Noise" and must be filtered. This prevents the system from being overwhelmed by the speed of the "pour."



## 3. Corrected Mapping: Logic vs. Coincidence
We have audited the repository files and extracted the following "Hard Truths" to replace the fragmented notes:

| File Location | Original Issue | Corrected Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `README.md` | Abstract Goals | Shifted to **Flight Dynamics** & **Biological Protection** |
| `UC_13954_Sketch` | Visual Only | Now defined as a **Coordinate Map** $(q, r, s)$ |
| `Archive/` | Narrative "Pour" | Converted to **Time-Series Data** aligned with $7.83\text{ Hz}$ |

## 4. Integrity Check (The Brutal Audit)
To ensure the math is undeniable:
1. **No Data Overlap:** If two data points share $(q, r, s)$, the one with the higher resonance alignment ($\omega \to 7.83$) is retained.
2. **Biological Buffer:** Any data requiring a carrier wave $> 300\text{ Hz}$ is rejected to protect Bee navigation.
