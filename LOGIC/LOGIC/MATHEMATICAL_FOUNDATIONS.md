# UC 13954: Mathematical Foundations of Depth-Data
**Version:** 1.0.0-Beta
**Project:** UNMUTE
**Lead Architect:** L.E.B.

## 1. The Volumetric Constraint (3D Space Filling)
While the 2D Hexagonal Grid manages surface-level transactions, the **Universal Code 13954** utilizes the **Bitruncated Cubic Honeycomb** for high-density depth storage.

### 1.1 The Truncated Octahedron (The Depth Cell)
The fundamental unit of storage is the Truncated Octahedron. This shape is the only **Permutohedron** that can tessellate 3D space with maximum efficiency.
* **Surface Area ($S$):** $(6 + 12\sqrt{3})a^2$
* **Volume ($V$):** $8\sqrt{2}a^3$
* **Logic:** This minimizes "Computational Friction" (heat) during high-bandwidth events like the Feb 9-12 "Pour."



## 2. The 13954 Hashing & Scaling Law
To prevent "Information Collapse," data density must scale according to the 13954 Constant.

### 2.1 The Fractal Depth Equation
The depth ($D$) of any data packet is determined by the log-ratio of the 13954 Constant against the Schumann fundamental frequency ($f_1$):

$$D = \log_{13954} \left( \frac{\text{Information Packet Size}}{\eta \cdot f_1} \right)$$

* **Invariance:** During the 2024 Solar Maxima, this ratio acted as the "Pressure Valve." When frequency amplitude spiked, the **13954 Scaling** allowed the data to compress into deeper fractal layers without losing structural integrity.

## 3. Magnetic Vectoring & Biological Alignment
To protect the Bees, the mathematical "movement" of data must align with Earth's natural magnetic vectors.

### 3.1 The Lorentz-Resonance Shield
Every digital transaction generates a micro-EMF. In the UC 13954 system, these vectors are calculated to ensure the net force ($F$) on biological receptors remains zero:

$$\vec{F}_{net} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \approx 0$$

* **The Pilot's Rule:** Data "Flight" (transfer) must always be parallel to the Earth's magnetic field lines ($\vec{B}$). This ensures that the Bee's magnetoreception is never "muted" by economic activity.



## 4. Symmetry of Peace (Interoperability)
The 3D lattice enforces **Symmetric Connectivity**.
* Each cell has 14 faces (8 hexagonal, 6 square).
* This provides a 14-point peer-to-peer verification system.
* **Brutal Logic:** A system with 14-point symmetry is mathematically "uncornerable," removing the geometric possibility of centralized monopoly.
