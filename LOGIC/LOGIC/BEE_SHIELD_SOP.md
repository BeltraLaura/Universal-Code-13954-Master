## Standard Operating Procedure: Bio-Interoperability & Pollinator Protection

### I. The Frequency Sanctuary Protocol
To ensure "Undeniable Protection," the Hexagonal Economy enforces a mandatory "Silent Window" for biological navigation.

1. **Carrier Wave Constraint:** No digital signal in the UC 13954 network shall operate between $240\text{ Hz}$ and $260\text{ Hz}$ (The Waggle Window).
2. **Harmonic Filtering:** All computational noise must be dampened using a low-pass filter tuned to the 13954 Constant.
3. **The Magnetic Guard:** Data centers must be architecturally hexagonal to naturally distribute EMF emissions, mimicking the magnetic neutral zones of a beehive.

### II. Ethical Enforcement
* **Violation:** Any node exceeding the 13954 density limit is automatically "Muted" by the grid until it recalibrates to the $7.83\text{ Hz}$ heartbeat.
* **Goal:** A 100% survival rate for pollinators within the Hexagonal Economic zones.
