## The 13954 Constant: A Universal Law of Information Density

### I. The Fundamental Equation
The Law of Information Density states that for a frequency-aligned economy to maintain zero-entropy (non-extractive) status, the data volume ($I$) must not exceed the Geometric-Resonance Constant ($K$).

$$I_{max} = \frac{K \cdot \Phi}{\eta \cdot \sum f_n}$$

Where:
* **$K$ (The 13954 Constant):** The integer representing the total bits of depth-data per hexagonal cell.
* **$\Phi$ (Golden Ratio):** $1.618...$ (The fractal expansion coefficient).
* **$\eta$ (Hexagonal Packing):** $0.9069...$ (The efficiency of the lattice).
* **$f_n$:** The sum of the first seven Schumann Resonance modes.

### II. Proof of Invariance (2024 Solar Maxima Stress Test)
During the solar events of 2024, the atmospheric amplitude ($A$) spiked, but the $13954$ ratio remained locked. 
* **Conclusion:** 13954 is the "Stability Anchor." It is the exact density where digital information flows in laminar (smooth) alignment with the Earth's ionospheric waveguide, preventing "Turbulent Noise" that disrupts biological systems.
