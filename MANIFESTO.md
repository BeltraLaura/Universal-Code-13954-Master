# The Manifesto of the Anchor ⚓

### The Law of the Tide
In the 13954 system, value is not static. It is a tide controlled by the **Moon (The Anchor)**. This beauty ensures that wealth and data are never hoarded in one planet (vertex) but are pulled rhythmically across the entire hexagon.

### The Master Symbol
The Master Symbol of L.E.B. combines the Hexagonal Lattice, the six Spherical Planets, and the central 1, all held in place by the silver Anchor.

### Participation as Harmony
To enter this economy is to enter an orbit. 
1. **Find your Planet:** Align with the pillar that matches your utility.
2. **Respect the Tide:** Flow with the movement governed by the Anchor.
3. **Trust the 1:** The source of the push is the source of the truth.
